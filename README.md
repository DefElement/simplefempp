# simplefem++: a simple example C++ finite element library.

[![DefElement verification](https://defelement.org/badges/simplefempp.svg)](https://defelement.org/verification/simplefempp.html)

simplefem++ is a very simple finite element definition library, that is used as an example
in the DefElement documentation.

## Using simplefem++

simplefem++ can be used to evaluate basis functions of Lagrange elements on triangles. To
create a Lagrange element on a triangle, the class `LagrangeElementTriangle` can
be initialised. For example, the following snippet creates a degree 3 Lagrange element on a
triangle:

```cpp
auto e = LagrangeElementTriangle(3);
```

A basis function of a simplefem++ element can be evaluated at a point using the `evaluate`
method. For example, the following snippet gets the value of the basis function with index 2 of a
Lagrange element with 10 basis functions at the point (0.3, 0.1):

```python
auto e = LagrangeElementTriangle(3);
double value = e.evaluate(2, {0.3, 0.1})
```

## Conventions
### Reference cell
The reference cell used by simplefem++ is the triangle with vertices at (-1, 0), (1, 0),
and (0, 1).

### Point ordering
The basis functions in simplefem++ are all defined using point evaluations. These points
are ordered lexicographically: for example, the points that define an element with ten points
are arranged like this:

```
      9
     / \
    7   8
   /     \
  4   5   6
 /         \
0---1---2---3
```


## Contributing
As simplefem++ is a small example library, it aims to only contain the features that
are necessary for the DefElement documentation. We are therefore unlikely to accept
any pull request that adds features to simplefem++. If you feel like a feature is
needed, please open an issue and we can discuss it before you work on it.
